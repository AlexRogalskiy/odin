## Odin - Git flavored zsh [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tylerreckart/odin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tylerreckart/odin) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/tylerreckart/odin](https://badges.gitter.im/tylerreckart/odin.svg)](https://gitter.im/tylerreckart/odin?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Odin is a [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) shell theme that focused around a git based workflow that provides you with a comprehensive overview of your projects status without overcrowding your shell.

## Installation

### For [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) users

Add `antigen bundle tylerreckart/odin` to your `.zshrc`. Antigen will clone and load the odin repository automatically the next time you start a zsh session.

### For [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) users

If you're using oh-my-zsh, follow these steps to install odin:

1. `cd zsh_custom/themes`  
2. `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylerreckart/odin && make`
3. Set `ZSH_THEME="odin"` in your `.zshrc`  

If you have any other issues, see the [oh-my-zsh documentation](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization) for more info.  

### For [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) users

1. Add `zgen load tylerreckart/odin` to your `.zshrc` with your other `zgen load` statements  
2. `zgen save` and zgen will automatically handle cloning the repository for you.

## Color schemes  
Odin comes packaged with two color schemes, however you can customize Odin with whatever color scheme you like. Color schemes can be found in the `colors` folder.
